## Information
``Sometimes I get imposter syndrome. I start to second guess myself and ask myself do I really know how to code, as you may know a really important part in coding is having confidence and believing in yourself that you are more then capable to code and are able to grasp the major concepts of coding. I decided to make an application that test me or perhaps the user on his or her coding knowledge better yet to test there technological terminology.``
